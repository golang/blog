## Report Issues / Send Patches

This repository uses Gerrit for code changes. To learn how to submit changes to
this repository, see https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html.

The main issue tracker for the blog is located at
https://github.com/golang/go/issues. Prefix your issue with "x/blog:" in the
subject line, so it is easy to find.

## Deploying

The Google Cloud project triggers a fresh deploy of the blog on each submit
but that deployment is published to a temporary URL.

To publish the blog to blog.golang.org, you need access to the
Cloud Console for the golang-org project.
Then:

1. Visit the
   [builds list](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=golang-org&query=trigger_id%3D%22c99674d3-32c1-4aec-ade4-ae2d5a844369%22)
   and click on the build hash for the most recent build
   with trigger name “Redeploy-blog-on-blog-commit”.

   Scrolling to the bottom of the build log, you will find a URL in a log message like

       Deployed service [blog] to [https://TEMPORARYURL.appspot.com]

2. Copy that URL and load it in your browser. Check that it looks OK.

3. Assuming it does, visit the
   [AppEngine versions list](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/versions?project=golang-org&serviceId=blog).
   Click “Migrate Traffic” on the new entry to move 100% of the blog.golang.org
   traffic to the new version.

4. You're done.
