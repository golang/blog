Summary: The week of June 23rd was a good week for gophers in San Francisco. Go was a big part of [Google I/O](https://www.google.com/events/io) on Wednesday and Thursday, and on Monday we took advantage of the large gopher population to run the [Go SummerFest](http://www.meetup.com/golangsf/events/170421402/), a special instance of the [GoSF](http://www.meetup.com/golangsf) meetup. This blog post is a recap of both events.

## Introduction

The week of June 23rd was a good week for gophers in San Francisco. Go was a big
part of [Google I/O](https://www.google.com/events/io) on Wednesday and
Thursday, and on Monday we took advantage of the large gopher population to run
the [Go SummerFest](http://www.meetup.com/golangsf/events/170421402/), a
special instance of the [GoSF](http://www.meetup.com/golangsf) meetup. This
blog post is a recap of both events.

## Go at Google I/O

On the Wednesday and Thursday, Go was at Google I/O in two different
formats: the Go booth in the sandbox area and the Go code labs available in the
code lab area and all around the world through
[I/O Extended](https://www.google.com/events/io/io-extended).

### The Go booth

The Go booth was part of the Developer Sandbox area.

For the two days of the conference, some gophers from Google and other
companies gave a series of talks and demonstrations. The talks were not
recorded, but the slides and some screencasts and blog posts will be shared
soon.

### The Go code lab

This year attendees of Google I/O had a code lab area with self-service
computers where they could sit and learn Go. The code labs were also available
to anyone through the Google I/O extended brand. You can try it yourself at
[io2014codelabs.appspot.com](https://io2014codelabs.appspot.com/).
